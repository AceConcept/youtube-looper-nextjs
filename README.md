## Tips for Best Experience

- Use decimal values for precise timing (e.g., 5.5 seconds)
- The application automatically validates your loop points
- The counter persists until you manually reset it
- You can change loop points while looping is active
- The video will automatically seek to your start point when looping begins

## Troubleshooting

**Video won't load?**
- Make sure you're using a valid YouTube URL
- Check your internet connection
- Try refreshing the page

**Loop not working?**
- Ensure start time is less than end time
- Make sure you've clicked "Set Loop Points" before starting
- Check that the video has loaded completely

**Counter not updating?**
- The counter only updates when a complete loop finishes
- Try resetting the counter if needed

**Server won't start?**
- Make sure you've run `npm install` first
- Check that port 3000 is available
- Try using a different port: `PORT=3001 npm run dev`
